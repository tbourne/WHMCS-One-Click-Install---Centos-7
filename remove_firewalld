##  This code portion will only disable and remove the FirewallD in Centos 7 
##  Lets Face it FirewallD is horrid an everyone else likes using iptables anyways.. You can skip this step if you realy want to


##  Disable and Stop the FirewallD service before anything else. 
systemctl mask firewalld  #Disable 
systemctl stop firewalld  #Stop 
 
##  Install the iptables related  packages
yum -y install iptables-services 
#I sware that everytime I see Yum It makes me think of cookie monster... Nommm Nooo 

## Install iptables 
systemctl enable iptables #make sure iptables start on load 
systemctl start iptables #start iptables
